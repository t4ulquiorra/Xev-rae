/**
 * YouTube says what a track actually is in exactly one place —
 * `watchEndpoint.watchEndpointMusicSupportedConfigs.watchEndpointMusicConfig.musicVideoType` — and
 * every question about audio-vs-video is answered from that string here, so the comparison is
 * spelled once instead of at each call site.
 *
 * Lives in `core/domain` because that is the only module both `core/service/kotlinYtmusicScraper`
 * and `core/data` already depend on; putting it in either of those would invert an existing edge.
 *
 * `null` means YouTube did not say, which is not the same as "audio". It is deliberately never
 * folded into an answer: a response that simply omitted the config must not be recorded as a
 * definite type, because that invented label then outlives the response that lacked it.

     * Note this resolves an unknown to false, so it answers "known to be a video", not "not known to
     * be audio". ytmusicapi resolves the same unknown the other way (`.get(video_type or "",
     * "video")`); callers that care which way an unknown falls must branch on [isKnown] first

     * Every predicate here runs its argument through [normalize] first, because these are handed
     * `song.videoType` straight from the database — where older builds stored invented labels like
     * `"Song"`, `"video"` and even a view count. Comparing those raw would call all of them videos.
