 * "Moods & Genres" browse result, kept as the list of sections YouTube actually returned.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT split into fixed `moodsMoments` / `genres` fields: the number and order of
 * sections is not stable. A signed-in account gets an extra "For you" section pushed in front,
 * which shifted every index by one — the app then labelled "For you" as Moods, "Moods & moments"
 * as Genres, and dropped the real Genres section entirely. ytmusicapi keys its result by section
 * title for exactly this reason.
