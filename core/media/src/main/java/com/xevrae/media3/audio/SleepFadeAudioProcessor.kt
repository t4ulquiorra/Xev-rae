/**
 * Media3 [AudioProcessor] that attenuates playback by the sleep timer's fade-out gain.
 *
 * This exists as a *second, independent volume line*. The crossfade ramp owns the player's own
 * `volume` and rewrites it fifty times per transition, so anything else sharing that line either
 * gets overwritten or has to be folded into every single write to it. Down here the two lines
 * simply multiply inside the audio pipeline and neither has to know the other exists — the same
 * split mpv gives us on desktop, where the crossfade rides the software volume while the sleep
 * fade rides the device mixer.
 *
 * Key design:
 * - [gain] is read fresh on every buffer rather than captured, so a fade that starts — or keeps
 *   advancing — in the middle of a crossfade still reaches the output.
 * - One instance per player, because an [AudioProcessor] carries per-stream state (format, output
 *   buffer) and cannot be shared across two of them. They all read the same gain, which is what
 *   makes a single write cover every player at once.
 * - At full gain the samples are passed through untouched, which is every moment except the last
 *   few seconds of a sleep timer.
 * - Supports PCM 16-bit, matching [CrossfadeFilterAudioProcessor] and what the YouTube sources
 *   decode to.
